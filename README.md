## react-minimal-kit

Very minimal react template that allows to create website/webapp prototype very quickly. Some of the features available in project are as follows:

**Babel** | **ES6** | **ESLint** | **React** | **SASS** | **Webpack**
## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone -o react-minimal-kit https://github.com/HugoSilva/react-minimal-kit.git [projectfolder]
$ cd [projectfolder]
$ npm install -g webpack
$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server
$ npm install
```
## Usage

#### Access app
1. Run `npm start`, this will create a local web server.
2. In your browser go to `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Build & Deployment
1. Run `npm run build`, this will create a `build` folder in the root of your project.
2. Access the `build` folder to see the release files.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple project template that I could use in the future, the objective is be able to easily create prototypes using react, ES6 and other technologies. There are many starter kits but this is the solution I feel more comfortable with, so please have that in mind if you do not like it.
